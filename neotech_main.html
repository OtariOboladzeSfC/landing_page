NEOTEC project has many files: from online shared docs and password manager app to offline documentations and deployment software and even training videos, so this single page will connect them all together.

                                        Odourcollect is a project that is already accomplished: it has webapp, android/ios apps, admin panel, database and it already met its deadline back in 2020.
                                        <br />
                                        Odourcollect project finished successfully.

                                        NEOTEC is a project that aims to take Odourcollect and extend its functionalities by using its database and add more features, give it more flexibility for integration with industry and make it more extensible to other projects.

                                        Even though Odourcollect is a successful project, to make it reusable there is need to redesign it.
                                        <br /><br />
                                        Odourcollect is designed by many developers throughout the years by different technologies, different methodologies and each of them without documenting any thought process behind them.
                                        <br /><br />
                                        NEOTEC will be made to be extensible, easy to respond to any future changes and flexible enough to be part of bigger family of EU projects.

                                    <div class="col-10">
                                        For the end user it does not really matter which technology is used behind the scenes to make an app work, but here is the catch: Odourcollect is a monolithic structure - it is designed to be Odourcollect and nothing more and it fights back for any structural changes because it does not want to be anything else than Odourcollect.
                                        <br /><br />
                                        But what if you want to change database? <br />
                                        A backend framework or even programming language? <br />
                                        What if IoT devices want to read/write data on the server? <br />
                                        What if that one guy who maintains Vue framework suddenly dies while eating too much sushi and you have to change frontend because no one maintains it anymore? <br />
                                        (Okay let that guy live, he is a good programmer) <br /><br />
                                        And so here is the NEOTEC: it will decouple everything from everything, make changes painless and create flexible app that can be deployed anywhere.

                                        <i>Why?</i> - NEOTEC is containerized and docker assures that app will be consistent on any platform, and AWS ECR is reliable platform and there is no need for private hub.

                                        <br />
                                        <i>Why?</i> - we do not have any infrastructure at SfC and even if we had, I can not guarantee safety of the app at that level as they do it at AWS. AWS/Microsoft Azure/Google Cloud are our best bet by now. <br />
                                        <br />

                                        Database will be accessed by ORM.
                                        <br />
                                        <i>Why?</i> - this gives us possibility to entirely swap MySQL database to SQLite or PostgreSQL or whatever and still maintain code as if nothing happened, so app will not be database language dependent. Also, ORM gives the power to object-oriented developer to talk to database without knowing SQL queries. <br />
                                        <br />

                                        Backend will be written with Laravel.
                                        <br />
                                        <i>Why?</i> - PHP developers are easiest to find if someone needs to review the code, and Laravel solves ORM, API, Routes, and server side rendered HTML together with many more problems. <br />
                                        <br />

                                        Communication to server will be RESTful.
                                        <br />
                                        <i>Why?</i> - REST gives the possibility to use the server for web app, mobile app, IoT communication and anything that can send HTTP request to it. <br />
                                        <br />

                                        Front end will be chosen between Vue and React.
                                        <br />
                                        <i>Why?</i> - Vue has shortest learning curve and React is easy to extend as React Native for mobile devices. <br />
